- 👋 Hi, I’m @PhiliusMaximus
- 👀 I’m interested in OSGEO4W fixing a bug regarding pdf files
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that open source software can be highly obfuscative to end-users like myself
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing - I'm an end-user and I have very few coding skills that would contribute in a meaningful way, though I am very grateful for your efforts!
- 📫 How to reach me at phillip.walton.1981@gmail.com
